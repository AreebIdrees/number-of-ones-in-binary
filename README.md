Title-Binary search
Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm that is applicable to sorted data. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and compares the target value with the middle element.

Algorithm
Start with the entire array.
Calculate the middle index of the search interval.
Compare the middle element with the target value.
If the middle element matches the target, return its index.
If the middle element is greater than the target, search the left half.
If the middle element is less than the target, search the right half.
Repeat the process with the remaining half until the target is found or the search interval is empty.
